1'st main test:
    One of the main things I'm seeing is that we want to add a parameter buffer_size, meant to be a multiple of batch_size and 
    meant to serve as a training buffer. In essense, we add a buffer size corresponding to a sufficient number of steps such
    that we have n number of batches to train on all at once. Right now, buffer_size = 10*batch_size.

    Another crutial detail is that the way we calculate entropy doesn't decrease wrt time. This is a massive problem
    as we would expect the agent would pick more suitable moves as the agent learns. To counteract this, we're going to 
    introduce exponential decay on the value c2. 

    Implemented:
    # Exponential Decay on C2
        self.c2 *= 0.98

    Current Hyperparameters are: 
    EPOCHS = 10

    PPO_Agent = PPO(n_actions=4, c1=1.0, c2=0.01, input_dims=8, gamma=0.99, alpha=0.0003, gae_lambda=0.95,
                    policy_clip=0.2, batch_size=64, buffer_size=64*5, n_epochs=10, LR=1e-4)


2'nd main test:
    In an attempt to prevent memorization/overfitting, I'm changing the random seed every episode. 
    I changed exponential decay to the one above after noting a large flaw in the last exponential decay function.
    I also am normalizing advantages, 

3'rd main test:
    First main change, .to(device) everything to optimize for performance. 
    Following Implementation Matters in PPO, one of the things they suggest is having 32 minibatches, 2000 timesteps per iteration, 
    where then these models are then trained for ~400 iterations. Before I make any further changes, I want to see where we're at in terms
    of loss and whatnaught before I add any future changes. The first graph represents the control.

    Change 1: 
        Added a clip function to the value function loss as seen in the paper 'Implementation Matters in Deep Policy Gradients:
        A Case Study on PPO and TRPO'
        The second graph is the loss curve associated with that. 
        Also changed includes a graph dictating mean reward of that episode.

    Change 2: 
        Added TanH layers to the neural network instead of relu layers. 
        Seemed to introduce faster improvement.

    Change 3:
        Removed the subtraction of the mean from the reward scaling.
        Let c2 = 0 as shown in the paper. 

    Change 4: 
        Let c2 have exponential decay once again, starting from 0.1. If that proves better results, the next step will be 
        to anneal the learning rate as well. 
        Annealing learning rate looks like it actually made it worse. Changing from Cosine Annealing to Linear Annealing
        
        Maybe because we start at a learning rate that's too low?
        Changing the learning rate from 1e-4 to 1e-2

        Learning rates, cosine, linear and step all seem to worsen performance on lunar lander. Setting annealing to false. 

4'th main test:
    Fixed the learning from 64*5 to 32 (buffer size) updates of 16 (minibatch size), which caused exploding ratios.
    Normalizing rewards relative to the entire buffer_size as well, rather than just the minibatches themselves.
